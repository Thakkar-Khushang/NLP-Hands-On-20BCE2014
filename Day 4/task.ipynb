    "corpus = [\"If there is a phrase I would prefer to retire from online bios, personal or professional, it is, “I love travel.” Or some approximation of that sentiment. To clarify, I am not against travellers or those who proudly flaunt their passion for travel. On the contrary, editing a travel magazine has now made me oddly protective of travellers and their ilk. My submission is that “love to travel,” suggested so casually, just doesn’t feel adequate to the depth of emotion it sparks in true devotees.\",\"Travellers can now fly directly between Pune and Singapore starting December 2, courtesy Vistara which will kick off three to four flights every week. International connections from Pune are rare (right now, Dubai is the sole one); visitors normally rely on Mumbai airport for the same. However, authorities are now planning to connect the city to two more Southeast Asian countries once the Singapore route is up and running.\", \"In a bid to ease paperwork for millions of tourists, the EU has proposed to make the Schengen visa process an online application system in the next few years. The Schengen visa allows travellers to visit and travel across 26 EU member nations for up to 90 days. Right now, tourists submit their visa application to a country’s local consulate and collect their passports in person once the visa is issued—a time-consuming process which became complicated during the last two years of the pandemic. The new proposal envisions a single digital visa application platform for all EU countries. Instead of a physical sticker, the visa is expected to be a cryptographically signed 2D bar code.\", \"Leaning out from a bridge leading into Wat Rong Khun, I squint at a stucco moat of outstretched hands and grisly skeletons. Two massive horns arch over the walkway, while a few steps ahead, giant statues of Death and Rahu guard the entrance, like burly bouncers poised to restrict my entry into heaven. “The bridge of rebirth,” I overhear a foreign couple talking. A swampland of desire—enslaved arms—lie in wait blocking a mortal’s road to nirvana. This was rebirth as an infernal spectre, not Elton John’s PG-13 “Circle of Life.”\"]"
